# dusty-couch

Fake listings site for our couch that friends can crash on.

### Running the app

`npm run dev` will spin up a local server accessible at `localhost:1234`.

`npm run build` will build the production version with Parcel.

`npm run deploy` will build it, bump the version number, and deploy the site to my Firebase account (ya know... if you have my credentials).
